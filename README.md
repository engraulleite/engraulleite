### About:
  - Data engineer with a background in Engineering and post-graduations in Project Management and Building Information Modeling (BIM).
  At present, I work as a data engineer, developing ETL and ELT pipelines using appropriate technologies for each business case. I try to take advantage of Cloud Computing and On-Premises technologies to make data available quickly, reliably, and cost-effectively for decision-making and predictive modeling.
  Data engineering plays a vital role in the information age and for this reason, as a data engineer, I aim to empower organizations to unlock the potential of data, foster innovations, and make strategic and informed decisions.
  Summarily, my curiosity extends to the domains of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Engineering, and new technology. I am always enthusiastic to embrace innovations.
